# reactPortfolio
## Description
### Project purpose was to use react to create a portfolio that employers and/or people interested in the user's work can access and read their page and where the user can showcase all of their skills and projects.
## User
### User should be able to see run the program from vs code terminal ans view portfolio in local browser. User should be able to view a portfolio complete with nav links, an avarar, contact form, and page displaying past works.
## Technologies
### GitHub was used to clone a new repository onto a computer and was also used to deploy the website when edits where finished and final version needed to be deployed. Visual Studio Code was used to create JS files and components/pages folders to hold page rendering information from scratch. GitBash Terminal was used to git add/commit/push edits made from local repository onto GitHub to update respository.
## Setup
### Tools needed are GitHub to name and clone repository onto local computer/repository. GitBash Terminal should be installed and one can clone repository with either an SSH key or the HTML URL and with the command-git clone-and copying in the URL or SSH key, upload to Terminal-making sure they are not within another folder but in the main branch-and using the commands git add . (press enter) then git commit -m "detailed description of your edits" (press enter) then git push (press enter) and entering their SSH key if promted. 
### A new folder should be created and once Visual Studio Code is installed, run the command "npx create-react-app . " to downlaod all the required packages and files you will need. Open the new folders in VS that make the required files (app.js, index.js, etc) and once finished with coding, you can view changes made in the terminal and visiting local browser. 
### GitBash Terminal is once again needed to updload edits made in your local repository onto GitHub-using the same commands of git add ./git commit -m/git push in order for the changes to be displayed when website is deployed.

## Status 
### reactPortfolio is working correctly in displaying the nav links, the avatar, the sections of "About Me, Resume, and Portfolio. Ufortunetly, Contact Me section is not rendered correctly and I was not able to render a sixth project in my portfolio section. I also was not able to link deployed links to my projects and was unable to render the footer all the way down to the bottom of the page. These are all issues I am planning to undertake during future revisions of this work!
