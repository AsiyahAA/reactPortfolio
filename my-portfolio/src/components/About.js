                    My name is Asiyah Ahmed and I am a web developer based in Seattle, Washington. I love making fun and
                    creative websites that are accessible for all. I attended the UW coding bootcamp where I learned all
                    the skills I need to do what I love. In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, watching movies (I
                    love Marvel films!), and cooking new meals.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I love learning from others and growing as a person and this field really allows for teamwork and
                    collaboration which is what I enjoy most about web development/coding. Please do not hesitate to
                    reach out or get in contact and I look forward to hearing from you!
